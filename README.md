# 123movies-laravel-app
123Movies-clone Laravel app. Decentraliezed storage & streaming system (see other repos). Parsing system as well. IMDB database & UI. 

Pretty old laravel app. 123movies original is no longer around. 
Back then we were able to use Google Drive for storage & streaming bandwidth.
Google caught on, so there's another laravel app that can be deployed on storage nodes. That app is here:

https://github.com/digitalnomad91/123movies-laravel-node
  
It will sync itself up with this app, which will store all information in the central database. The main app will delegate out tasks to the node servers.
  
There's also a 3rd piece, though I'm sure it's not good anymore. It was just a parsing bot that would scan other 123movies sites & snub the urls for each movie. The more streaming points we had for a movie, the better services we could provide (particularly if we didn't have to actually host the files ourselves).
  
  
Was fun at the time, doubt it would work as it did then today. 
  
Still though, fun to peek at and maybe even find some salvagable pieces of code.
  
Enjoy!
